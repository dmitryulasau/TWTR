# Async JavaScript

## Introduction

Create a simple typing game where the player must type words that appear on the screen as quickly as possible using asynchronous JavaScript. The words should appear randomly, and the player should be able to type them in any order. The game should end when the player types a certain number of words correctly or incorrectly.


## Assignment Details

Asynchronous features:

- The words should appear on the screen at random intervals. 
- The player's score should be updated in real time as they type words correctly or incorrectly. 
- The game should end when the player types a certain number of words correctly or incorrectly. 

## Requirements

1. Create a function that does what the prompt describes.
2. Handle the success and failure of each async promise
3. Utilize an online code editor such as www.codepen.io to easily write and test your functions.

## Evaluation Criteria

The instructor will assess the submitted assignment based on the following criteria:

1. Correct Asynchronous Syntax (20%)

  -	Functions fulfill the specified requirements.
  -	Properly used the async and await keywords.
  -	Correct syntax used to create and return promises.
  -	Utilized tryâ€¦catch for error handling.

2. Error Handling (25%)

  -	Both expected and unexpected errors are handled.
  -	Custom error messages are utilized to provide user-friendly feedback.

3. Async Behavior and Promises (20%)

  -	Async behavior is simulated using setTimeout.
  -	Promises are correctly created and chained.
  -	Resolved and rejected promises are handled with .then() and .catch().

4. Concurrency Handling (15%)

  -	Concurrency is handled with tools such as Promise.all() or async/await.
  -	Prevented race conditions and concurrent date access.

5. Code Readability and Documentation (20%)

  - Code is easy to understand and self-explanatory.
  - Clear separation of concerns is maintained.
  - Clear comments and appropriate documentation is utilized for complex sections or algorithms.


## Submission Deadline

The assignment must be submitted via GitHub Classroom by the specified date provided by the instructor.
Please note that any additional instructions or clarifications will be communicated separately by the instructor.

Good luck with your assignment!
